# MotoGPStats

Project showcases motorcycle racing results for MotoGP.

Project uses the following tools:

```
React
Typescript
Express
Bulma
```


## Getting Started

Before beginning on a new fork, we need to install the necessary dependencies for the project.

Run the following command in the base folder of the project (i.e. C:/michaelmills/MotoGP/):

```
npm install
```

### Development
We're using _webpack-dev-server_** to hot-reload changes. It eliminates the need to restart
the server during file saves.

Run the following command to start the dev server:

```
npm start
```

Then navigate to _http://localhost:8080_**.

The server log is running on verbose so all rebuilds will appear on the log.


## Deployment
