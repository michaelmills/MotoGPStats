# MotoGPStats

## Getting Started

Before beginning on a new fork, we need to install the necessary dependencies for the project.

Ran the following command in the base folder of the project (i.e. C:/michaelmills/MotoGP/):

```
npm install
```

### Development
We're using *webpack-dev-server* to hot-reload changes. It eliminates the need to restart
the server during file saves.

Run the following command to start the dev server:

```
npm start
```

Then navigate to *http://localhost:8080*.

The server log is running on verbose so all rebuilds will appear on the log.
